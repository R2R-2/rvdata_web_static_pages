  <h2 class="mainbody">Data Submission Guidelines</h2>
  <h3>Timely Data Submission</h3>
  <ul class="mainbody">
    <li>R2R's goal is to receive new cruise data distributions (“distros”) on at least a quarterly basis.</li>
    <li>Timely submission of data expedites the data publication process and gives R2R more time to verify and validate network-transmitted data.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Avoid Data Update Requests</h3>
  <ul class="mainbody">
    <li>It is difficult to make changes to data once they have been processed at R2R, and particularly if they have been archived at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.</li>
    <li>Please provide complete, finalized distros.</li>
    <li>If changes are needed, please communicate with R2R in advance of sending a new distro.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Separate Oversize Filesets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Filesets over 500 gigabytes, such as those commonly generated by the SBP-29 & EK-80, should be separated from the rest of their distros and sent to R2R as separate tarballs.</li>
    <li>The directory structure of the separate distro should match that of the original such that, if both were merged, the result would be identical to the original distro.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Include Deep Checksum Files (.md5deep extension)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>md5deep files list the contents of a distro and generate md5 checksums for each file. R2R uses these files to verify that its copy of the distro matches the operator's copy.</li>
    <li>Generating an md5deep file helps R2R perform distro integrity checks and is highly recommended.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Safe and Effective File Naming</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Include date strings in filenames if possible. We use these strings to verify what date corresponds to which file. Avoid Julian Day date/time as it interferes with our automated date checking processes.</li>
    <li>Don't put special characters in filenames. Examples of problem file names:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>“Seapath_330_User's_Guide.pdf”: this shouldn't have an apostrophe.</li>
      <li>“Knudsen comparison with SBP39_top line of Oceanus Z_W-bound_same line, same time.jpg”: this shouldn't have commas or spaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Network Transfers (Globus)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R is moving away from physical storage handoffs to network transfers.</li>
    <li>R2R's preferred network transfer method is Globus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Globus performs checks on all transmitted data to ensure file integrity remains uncompromised, and ensures security of the transfer.</li>
      <li>Pushing data to R2R's endpoint does not require a subscription.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are pushing a particularly large distro, please let us know by emailing info@rvdata.us beforehand!</li>
        <li>R2R is happy to help you set up and configure Globus.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Regularly Maintain Device Format Documentation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data format descriptions are critical for end users, and R2R will begin to use these documents to support automated checks on the data.</li>
    <li>Include format description documents for all device types in a top-level “docs” directory. This should contain the name of the device, parameter names/description of all the fields in the data, structure, units, etc. Please include this for each NMEA string if you are using NMEA formats. <a href="https://r2r-2.github.io/rvdata_web_static_pages/example_format_document.txt">Here is an example</a> of a device format document that covers the desired information (other document formats can be used).</li>
    <li>Keep format documents up to date through time.</li>
    <li>R2R serves device data format documentation to the end user.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Data-Specific Asks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for empty files i.e. not zero-byte but missing required data.</li>
    <li>Geophysical data: include gravity ties and magnetometer layback in the distro.</li>
    <li>Confirm water column sonar data contains navigation.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of navigation in wcd data creates downstream issues for archiving at NCEI.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
