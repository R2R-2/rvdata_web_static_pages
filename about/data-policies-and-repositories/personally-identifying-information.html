    Underway data and documentation collected by academic research vessels are routinely submitted to the NSF-supported Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program at the end of each cruise, and deposited in the NOAA National Data Centers for permanent archiving and dissemination. As such, they must comply with federal guidelines including the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) policy on Electronic Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (ref. U.S. Office of Management and Budget,
