<p class="mainbody">Underway data and documentation collected by academic research vessels are routinely submitted to the NSF-supported Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program at the end of each cruise, and deposited in the NOAA National Data Centers for permanent archiving and dissemination. As such, they must comply with federal guidelines including the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) policy on Electronic Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (ref. U.S. Office of Management and Budget, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2007/m07-16.pdf">Memorandum M-07-16, “Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information”</a>).</p>
<p class="mainbody">Per DoC policy as published by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), PII is defined as “information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, .. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual.” PII is further classified as “Sensitive” or “Non-Sensitive”.</p>
