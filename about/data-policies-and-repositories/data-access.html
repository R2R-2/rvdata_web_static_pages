<p class="mainbody">R2R archives a full copy of all routine underway shipboard data acquired from the installed environmental senor suite, as recorded by the operating institution, including at least the full distribution as it was delivered to the Chief Scientist at the end of each cruise. This copy may be recovered through R2R by the Vessel Operator or Chief Scientist on request. An inventory of the distribution is posted online in the <a href="/search">Cruise Catalog</a>.</p>
<p class="mainbody">Individual data sets are broken out according to instrument system. After any proprietary holds are cleared, they are submitted to the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a>, if appropriate, and are available from download links as part of the <a href="/search">R2R Catalog</a>.</p>
<p class="mainbody">R2R publishes a suite of <a href="/data">Standard Products</a> for each cruise, and serves them directly as part of the <a href="/search">Catalog</a>.</p>
<p class="mainbody">R2R does not handle any specialized facility instrument data (e.g. deep submergence, seismic) or data acquired with science party instrumentation. These data are managed by <a href="/about/data-policies-and-repositories">other disciplinary data repositories</a>.
