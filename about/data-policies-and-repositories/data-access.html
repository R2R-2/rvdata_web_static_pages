    R2R archives a full copy of all routine underway shipboard data acquired from the installed environmental senor suite, as recorded by the operating institution, including at least the full distribution as it was delivered to the Chief Scientist at the end of each cruise. This copy may be recovered through R2R by the Vessel Operator or Chief Scientist on request. An inventory of the distribution is posted online in the
