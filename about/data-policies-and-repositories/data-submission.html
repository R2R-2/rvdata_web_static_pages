   <h2 class="EB-28 blue mt-5 mb-4">Cruise, Vessel, and Device Information</h2>
   <p class="SSP-20 grey">The Rolling Deck to Repository program (R2R; rvdata.us) provides shore-side data management for routine underway environmental sensor data collected on US academic research vessels. This work is a collaboration with vessel operators and chief scientists. The <a href="https://www.rvdata.us/community/roles-responsibilities">Research Vessel Data Management Roles and Responsibilities</a> document gives a high-level description of the various operator, Chief Scientist and R2R responsibilities, whereas this document describes in detail how operators should provide their data to R2R. For guidance on metadata that R2R expects from ship operators please see <a href="https://www.rvdata.us/about/technical-details/metadata">Metadata Requirements</a>.</p>
   <h2 class="EB-28 blue mt-5 mb-4">R2R needs the following information from vessel operators</h2>
   <p class="SSP-20 grey"> </p>
   <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
      <li>A description of all standard underway devices onboard the vessel, including make, model, location and filenames of data in directory structure and data format description. R2R should be notified of any changes in equipment or data location before sending a cruise data distribution. Operators are encouraged to use the <a href="https://www.rvdata.us/community/ship-operators/directory-structure">standard directory structure</a> for cruise data developed by the R2R program and the operator community. </li>
      <li>
         Cruise data distribution(s): 
         <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
            <li>Includes only vessel operated, underway data in standard format as described to R2R for this operator/vessel</li>
            <li>Includes Navigation Data (at least one clearly-identified, full resolution GPS data set for creating a simple ship track on a location map)</li>
            <li>Includes a md5deep report of all files to allow verification of distro content</li>
            <li>Excludes any science party data, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii">Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</a>, recreational communications or imagery, anything that would be <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-definitions.html">copyright infringement</a> (music, movies, …), etc.</li>
            <li>Excludes data collected by dedicated facilities such as the National Marine Seismic Facility (NMSF), <a href="https://www.unols.org/ships-facilities/national-deep-submergence-facility-ndsf">National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF)</a> or <a href="https://obsic.whoi.edu/experiments/obsip-experiment-archive/">The Ocean Bottom Seismic Instrument Center (OBSIC)</a>. Such data are already archived by other programs.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   <h2 class="EB-28 blue mt-5 mb-4">Data Submission Guidelines</h2>
   <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
      <li>
        Timely Data Submission
        <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
            <li>R2R's goal is to receive new cruise data distributions (“distros”) on at least a quarterly basis.</li>
            <li>Timely submission of data expedites the data publication process and gives R2R more time to verify and validate network-transmitted data.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         Avoid Data Update Requests
         <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
            <li>It is difficult to make changes to data once they have been processed at R2R, and particularly if they have been archived at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.</li>
            <li>Please provide complete, finalized distros.</li>
            <li>If changes are needed, please communicate with R2R in advance of sending a new distro.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate Oversize Filesets
        <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
          <li>Filesets over 500 gigabytes, such as those commonly generated by the SBP-29 & EK-80, should be separated from the rest of their distros and sent to R2R as separate tarballs.</li>
          <li>The directory structure of the separate distro should match that of the original such that, if both were merged, the result would be identical to the original distro.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         Network Transfers (Globus)
         <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
            <li>R2R is moving away from physical storage handoffs to network transfers.</li>
            <li>
               R2R's preferred network transfer method is Globus. 
               <ul>
                  <li>Globus performs checks on all transmitted data to ensure file integrity remains uncompromised, and ensures security of the transfer.</li>
                  <li>
                     Pushing data to R2R's endpoint does not require a subscription. 
                     <ul>
                        <li>If you are pushing a particularly large distro, please let us know by emailing info@rvdata.us beforehand!</li>
                        <li>R2R is happy to help you set up and configure Globus.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
