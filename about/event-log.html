    The R2R Eventlogger is a program that creates a record of the scientific sampling events conducted during a cruise. It uses the Electronic Logbook (ELOG) program (
    <a href="https://elog.psi.ch/elog/" class="grey-underline">https://elog.psi.ch/</a>) by Stefan Ritt. The underlying concept is that each use of a sampling device (e.g. CTD, MocNESS, gravity core) gets logged in a digital file with sufficient information to uniquely and accurately describe the event. When the R2R Eventlogger is used during a cruise and included in the cruise data distribution, it assists future users of the data to understand what events occurred during the cruise.
  </p>

  <p class="SSP-20 grey">
    Each entry in the scientific sampling event log includes date and time (UTC), position (latitude and longitude), fields for station and cast identifier, sampling instrument name (e.g. CTD, MOC10), the action being performed, the name of person responsible for the sampling event, and a comment field to record additional information. The minimum requirements to document a sampling event are the instrument, the action (deploy,recover,etc.) and the author of the event.
  </p>

  <p class="SSP-20 grey">
    Events can be edited, duplicated, or entered at a later time than they occur. A snapshot of date/time/gps position is kept during the cruise and is employed to determine the ship's location at the time the event occurred. For example; if an event is entered late with the correct time in UTC of the actual event, the R2R Eventlogger will search the GPS snapshot database for the correct latitude and longitude and automatically enter it for the event.

    The objective of maintaining a sampling event log is to create an accurate record of all sampling events from a research cruise. Some best practice guidelines to ensure an accurate and complete Eventlogger include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="SSP-20 grey">
      The Eventlogger should be started when the ship leaves port, and concluded upon arrival.
    </li>
    <li class="SSP-20 grey">
      Capture comments and anecdotal information for a sampling event in the provided free text field.
    </li>
    <li class="SSP-20 grey">
      Accurate position (latitude and longitude) data is recorded for each event, but periodic spot checks with the ship's GPS should be done to ensure any time/position related problems are caught quickly.
    </li>
    <li class="SSP-20 grey">
      Contents of the Eventlogger should be reviewed regularly during a cruise to ensure completeness and accuracy.
    </li>
  </ul>

    The final Eventlogger can be exported as a plain text csv file, which can be included in the Cruise Data Distribution.
