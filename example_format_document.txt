Data Format Description:
The file contains GGA, VTG, and ZDA strings, alternating line-by-line, preceded by decimal unix system timestamps. Definitions follow.

Definition of Unix time:
Decimal seconds since 00:00:00 UTC - January 1, 1970 (minus leap seconds)

Definition of GGA:
GGA - essential fix data which provide 3D location and quality data.

Example Record: $GPGGA, 123519, 4807.038,N, 01131.000,E, 1,08, *47

where:
      123519           Fix taken at 12:35:19 UTC
      4807.038, N      Latitude 48 degrees 07.038 minutes North
      01131.000,E      Longitude 11 degrees 31.000 minutes East
      1                Fix quality: 0 = fix not available or invalid
                             1 = GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) mode, fix valid
                             2 = differential GPS (DGPS), SPS mode, fix valid
                             3 = GPS Precise Point Positioning (PPS) mode, fix valid
      08              Number of satellites being tracked
      *47             Checksum, always begins with *


Definition of ZDA:
ZDA - Date and Time

Example Record: $GPZDA, 201530.18,04,07,2002,01,00*60

where:
      201530.18      hours, minutes, and seconds expressed as hhmmss.ss
                          20      2-digit hour [24 hour clock]
                          15      2-digit minute
                          30.18   decimal seconds
      04            2-digit day,
      07            2-digit month
      2002          4-digit year
      01            2-digit local timezone hours: -13 to 13
      00            2-digit local timezone minutes: 0 to 59
      *60           Checksum, begins with *
