        The Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program provides fleet-wide 
        management of underway data to ensure preservation of, and access to, 
        our national oceanographic research assets.
      </h1>

      <p class="SSP-20 grey">
        With their global capability and diverse array of sensors, research 
        vessels are essential mobile observing platforms for ocean science. 
        Data collected on every expedition are of high value, given the high 
        cost and increasingly limited resources for ocean exploration. 
      </p>

      <p class="SSP-20 grey">
        R2R catalogs and submits the underway environmental sensor data 
        routinely acquired on research expeditions to long-term public archives, 
        including the 
        <a href="http://ncei.noaa.gov/" class="grey-underline">
          NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
        </a>.
        Data from each cruise are submitted directly to R2R by the vessel 
        operator, rather than by the science party.
      </p>

      <p class="SSP-20 grey">
        R2R provides essential documentation and standard products for each 
        expedition, as well as tools to document shipboard data acquisition 
        activities while underway. Post-cruise quality assessment of selected 
        underway data types is provided, designed to evaluate the completeness 
        of data and data documentation and to provide measures of instrument 
        operation. Assessment of underway meteorological data is implemented in 
        near-real-time in partnership with the 
        <a href="http://samos.coaps.fsu.edu/html/" class="grey-underline">
          SAMOS program at FSU
        </a>.
