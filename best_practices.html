  <p class="SSP-20 grey">R2R encourages the use of community best practices in instrument operation and data
    collection. Below are best practice documents and efforts recommended by R2R. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@rvdata.us">contact us</a> with questions, and to let us know if you are aware of
    additional practices to include.</p>

  <h2 class="SSP-20 bold grey">Data Submission Guidelines</h2>
  <h3>Timely Data Submission</h3>
  <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
    <li>R2R's goal is to receive new cruise data distributions (which henceforth will be referred to as distros) on at least a quarterly basis.</li>
    <li>Timely submission of data expedites the data publication process and gives R2R more time to verify and validate network-transmitted data.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Avoid Data Update Requests</h3>
  <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
    <li>It is difficult to make changes to data once they have been processed at R2R, and particularly if they have been archived at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.</li>
    <li>R2R prefers to:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>receive complete distros.</li>
      <li>serve data as-is and make adjustments by providing documentation rather than altering files or directories.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Separate Oversize Filesets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Filesets over 500 gigabytes, such as those commonly generated by the SBP-29 & EK-80, should be separated from the rest of their distros and sent to R2R as a separate tarballs.</li>
    <li>The directory structure of the separate distro should match that of the original such that, if both were merged, then the result would be identical to the original distro.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Include Deep Checksum Files (.md5deep extension)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>md5deep files list the contents of a distro and generate md5 checksums for each file. R2R uses these files to verify that its copy of the distro matches the operator's copy.</li>
    <li>Generating an md5deep file helps R2R perform distro integrity checks and is highly recommended.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Safe and Effective File Naming</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Include date strings in filenames if possible. We use these strings to verify what date corresponds to which file. Avoid Julian Day date/time as it interferes with our automated date checking processes.</li>
    <li>Don't put special characters in filenames. Examples of problem file names:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>"Seapath 330 User's Guide.pdf": this shouldn't have an apostrophe.</li>
      <li>"Knudsen comparison with SBP39_top line of Oceanus Z_W-bound_same line, same time.jpg": this shouldn't have commas or spaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Standardize the Directory Structure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R uses regexes to map files to devices.</li>
    <li>Consolidating files into directories and standardizing the directory structure makes it easier for R2R to maintain up-to-date mapping to ensure that all relevant data files are found.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition systems are an effective means of standardizing the directory structure for serial devices and perform other useful bookkeeping procedures like enforcing valid filenames.</li>
      <li>A standardized directory structure also helps scientists who work across multiple vessels.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Network Transfers (Globus)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R is moving away from physical storage handoffs in network transfers.</li>
    <li>R2R's preferred network transfer method is Globus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Globus performs checks on all transmitted data to ensure file integrity remains uncompromised, and ensures security of the transfer.</li>
      <li>Pushing data to R2R's endpoint does not require a subscription.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are pushing a particularly large distro, please let us know via info@rvdata.us beforehand!</li>
        <li>R2R is happy to help you set up and configure Globus.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Data-Specific Asks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for empty files i.e. not zero-byte but missing required data.</li>
    <li>Geophysical data: Include gravity ties and magnetometer layback in the distro to ensure R2R has current information for QA/DP.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Include documentation for devices in a top-level docs directory</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Confirm water column sonar data contains navigation.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of navigation in wcd data creates downstream issues for NCEI archival.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Regularly Maintain Device Format Documentation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R serves device data format documentation to the end user.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The end user directly benefits from detailed and current device documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>R2R is looking to overhaul our system to work with these documents to introduce automation and checks on the data.</li>
  </ul>
