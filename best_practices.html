  <p class="SSP-20 grey">R2R encourages the use of community best practices in instrument operation and data
    collection. Below are best practice documents and efforts recommended by R2R. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@rvdata.us">contact us</a> with questions, and to let us know if you are aware of
    additional practices to include.</p>
  <h2 class="SSP-20 bold grey">R2R Operator Best Practices</h2>
  <h3>Timely Data Submission</h3>
  <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
    <li>R2R's goal is to receive new cruise data distributions (which henceforth will be referred to as distros) on at least a quarterly basis.</li>
    <li>Timely submission of data expedites the data publication process and gives R2R more time to verify and validate network-transmitted data.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Avoiding Data Update Requests</h3>
  <ul class="SSP-20 grey">
    <li>R2R is a repository not an archive which means that much of R2R's data is often sent off to archives like NCEI.</li>
    <li>R2R strives to avoid updates to data files unless deemed necessary and when data files are sent to an archive updates become much more difficult</li>
    <li>Timely submission of data expedites the data publication process and gives R2R more time to verify and validate network-transmitted data.</li>
    <li>R2R prefers to:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>receive distros complete.</li>
      <li>serve data as-is and fill in gaps with documentation rather than making manual changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Separating Oversize Filesets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Oversize filesets totalling 500+ gigabytes such as those commonly generated by the SBP-29 & EK-80 should be separated off from the rest of their distros and sent to R2R as a separate tarballs.</li>
    <li>The directory structure of the separate distro should match that of the original such that, if both were merged then the result would be identical to the original distro.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Include Deep Checksum Files (.md5deep extension)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>md5deep files list the contents of a distro and generate md5 checksums for each file. R2R uses these files to verify that its copy of the distro matches the operator's copy.</li>
    <li>Generating an md5deep file helps R2R perform distro integrity checks and is highly recommended.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Safe and Effective File Naming</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It's helpful to have date strings in filenames. We use these strings to verify what date corresponds to which file.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid Julian Day date/time as it interferes with our automated date checking processes.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Don't put special characters in filenames.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Seapath 330 User's Guide.pdf <- this shouldn't have an apostrophe</li>
      <li>Knudsen comparison with SBP39_top line of Oceanus Z_W-bound_same line, same time.jpg <- this shouldn't have commas or spaces</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Standardizing the Directory Structure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R defines regex mappings that identify files for the purpose of mapping them to devices.</li>
    <li>By consolidating and standardizing data directories and files within distros you make it easier for R2R to maintain up-to-date mapping which ensures that its picks up all relevant data files.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition systems are an effective means of standardizing the directory structure for serial devices and perform other useful bookkeeping procedures like enforcing valid filenames.</li>
      <li>A standardized directory structure also helps scientists who work across multiple vessels.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Network Transfers (Globus)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R is moving away from physical storage handoffs in favor of data transfer over the network.</li>
    <li>R2R's preferred network transfer method is using Globus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Globus performs checks on all transmitted data to ensure file integrity remains uncompromised.</li>
      <li>Pushing data to R2R's endpoint does not require a subscription.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are pushing a particularly large distro, please let us know first via info@rvdata.us beforehand!</li>
        <li>R2R is happy to help you set up and configure Globus.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Globus also ensures security of the transfer.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Data-Specific Asks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-check for empty files i.e. not zero-byte but missing required data.</li>
    <li>Geophysical data: Include gravity ties and magnetometer layback in the distro to ensure R2R has current information for QA/DP.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Include documentation for devices in a top-level docs directory</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Confirm water column sonar data contains navigation.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of navigation in wcd data creates downstream issues for NCEI archival.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Regularly Maintain Device Format Documentation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>R2R serves device data format documentation to the end user.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The end user directly benefits from detailed and current device documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>R2R is looking to overhaul our system to work with these documents to introduce automation and checks on the data.</li>
  </ul>
