<h2 class="header h2">Key stakeholders in the coordinated management of oceanographic research data include ship operators, scientists, technical staff, funding agencies, and the public.</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="header h2">R2R benefits each in a range of ways:</h2>
<p class="mainbody"><b>Operators:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures the field data sets from underway environmental sensors from each cruise are consistently delivered to National Data Centers, freeing operators of this obligation</li>
  <li>Removes obligations of operators to fulfill data requests long after a cruise has ended</li>
  <li>Provides feedback and tools to improve data quality and documentation</li>
  <li>Facilitates cruise planning</li>
  <li>Leverages infrastructure and content of centralized R2R cruise database to facilitate national permitting and clearance processes</li>
</ul>
<p class="mainbody"><b>Shipboard Science Team:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures field data sets from underway environmental sensors are consistently delivered to National Data Centers, freeing science team of this obligation</li>
  <li>Facilitates cruise planning</li>
  <li>Facilitates submission of other cruise data (national facility and science party) to <a href="/about/data-policies-and-repositories">disciplinary data management systems</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="mainbody"><b>Shore-based Scientists:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures field data sets from the underway environmental sensors are made available to the broad scientific community for re-use</li>
  <li>Makes well-documented data available for global syntheses and compilations</li>
</ul>
<p class="mainbody"><b>Funding Agencies:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures agency-mandated data sharing obligations for environmental sensor data are fulfilled via R2R to National Data Center data delivery pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p class="mainbody"><b>National Data Centers:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures that well-documented environmental sensor data are routinely archived and made publicly available as a result of the direct R2R to National Data Center data delivery pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p class="mainbody"><b>Data Assembly Centers:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures that well-documented environmental sensor data are routinely available to Disciplinary Data Assembly Centers focused on detailed analysis of specific data types</li>
</ul>
<p class="mainbody"><b>Public:</b></p>
<ul class="mainbody spacedList">
  <li>Ensures long-term preservation of cruise-based research data collected with public funds</li>
  <li>Provides broader public accessibility to cruise-based data via National Data Centers</li>
</ul>
